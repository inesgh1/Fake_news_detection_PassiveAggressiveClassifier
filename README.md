# Fake_news_detection_PassiveAggressiveClassifier
About Detecting Fake News with Python: 

This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, I build a TfidfVectorizer on the dataset.
Then, I initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell  how well  model fares.
